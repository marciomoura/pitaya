/**
 * @class elapsed_timer
 * @brief A generic elapsed time measurement component for real-time control applications.
 *
 * This component provides precise elapsed time measurement with configurable sampling time.
 * It is designed for use in control loops where timing information is critical, such as
 * state machine timeouts, pulse duration measurement, and event timing.
 *
 * The timer follows the architectural patterns:
 * - Configuration via `configure_` methods
 * - Main execution via `update()` method
 * - State access via `get_` methods
 * - Real-time safety with no dynamic allocation
 *
 * @note This timer is incremental and relies on regular `update()` calls at the
 *       configured sampling period for accurate timing.
