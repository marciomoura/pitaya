 * @brief A high-precision timer for measuring time intervals in real-time systems.

 * event durations in control systems. It provides deterministic timing
 * measurements suitable for real-time applications such as commutation
 * monitoring in power electronics.
 *
 * The timer operates by accumulating elapsed time based on a fixed sampling
 * period, ensuring predictable behavior in time-critical control loops.
